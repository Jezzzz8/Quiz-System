## Introduction

Quizzes are an important part of education because they help teachers check what students have learned and allow students to test their own knowledge. To make quizzes easier to use, we have created a Quiz System. This system helps teachers create and manage quizzes while allowing students to take quizzes and see their scores. It is designed to be simple and organized, making the quiz process more effective for both teachers and students.
The Quiz Management System has two main parts. The Teacher Options allow teachers to create quizzes by adding their name, quiz name, and choosing the quiz type, which can be multiple-choice or direct-answer. They can also add questions, give answer choices for multiple-choice quizzes, and set the correct answers. Teachers can delete quizzes, check student scores, and remove student records. The Student Options allow students to pick a quiz, answer the questions, and get their score immediately. They can also look at their past scores to see their progress. When they are finished, they can exit the system. This Quiz System makes it easier for teachers to manage quizzes and for students to learn from them.
